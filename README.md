This is a Python Package for analyzing probability distributions.

This distribution deals with gaussian probability density functions, binary probability density functions, mean, and standard deviations of a given dataset in a text file.

This program will read the dataset, calculate mean, standard deviation, plot histogramsm probability functions for both binary and gaussian probability density functions. It will also add two gaussian distributions, if required by user.

The only prerequisite package required for this program is matplotlib which can be downloaded with pip or conda.

You can uninstall this package using pip uninstall.
